# Anaglyph Vision Therapy Game

This computer application is designed to make vision therapy exercises more enjoyable by gamifying them into a challenging letter puzzle game. To play, users must scan a grid of similar looking sequences to find a hidden target character or symbol. The game's difficulty levels and features can be customized by the user. They can also choose to play a quick version that increases in difficulty as their performance improves. To train their eye teaming skills, users can opt to wear red-blue anaglyph lenses that limit each eye's ability to see half of the items in the grid. The application tracks game parameters, scores, and other metrics to record and monitor user performance, which will be held in a database only accessible to the healthcare providers.
